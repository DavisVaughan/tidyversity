üè´ Tidy tools for academics

## Description

Tidy tools designed for use in academic research. Use functions to wrangle (e.g., wide-to-long or long-to-wide) and statistically analyze (e.g., Cronbach's alpha) data using conventions/techniques commonly observed in academic research. This package uses tidy evaluation (a form of non-standard evaluation) for ease of use and helps researchers keep their data and analysis tidy.

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of tidyacademic from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("tidyacademic")
```
-->

Install the development version from [Github](https://github.com/mkearney/tidyacademic) with:

```{r install}
## install devtools if not already
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}
## install tidyacademic from Github
devtools::install_github("mkearney/tidyacademic")
```

## Data sets

Comes with two data sets. 

1. `polcom_survey` consists of survey responses to demographic, background, and likert-type attitudinal items about political communication.

```{r polcom_survey}
polcom_survey
```

2. `twitter_data` consists of tweet-level observations.

```{r twitter_data}
twitter_data
```

## Descriptive statistics

Return summary statistics in the form of a data frame.

```{r cars}
## summary stats for social media use (numeric) variables
summarize_numeric(polcom_survey, smuse1:smuse3)

## summary stats for respondent sex and race (categorical) variables
summarize_categorical(polcom_survey, sex, race)
```

Estimate Cronbach's alpha for a set of variables.

```{r reliability}
## reliability of social media use items
cronbachs_alpha(polcom_survey, smuse1:smuse3)
```
